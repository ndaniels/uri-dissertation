Here is a doctoral dissertation template for University of Rhode Island's "manuscript format" dissertation (typical in computer science and other fields).

Some quick notes on how it works:

- A manuscript format is assumed, with separate bibliographies immediately following each manuscript and all appendices at the very end.
- The "tex" and "bib" files for each manuscript are organized in their respective folders.
- The file named "boilerplate_revised.tex" is used to generate the front matter of the dissertation.
- The file "thesis_compile.tex" defines all required packages and populates the rest of the document.

This is adapted from James Houghton's 2024 dissertation in Industrial & Systems Engineering, which in turn is a modification of Karen Tracey's 2008 version for GSO, which in turn is based on one from Timothy Toolan in Electrical Engineering.
